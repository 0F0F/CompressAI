CompressAI
==========

:mod:`CompressAI` (*compress-ay*) is a machine learning library for end-to-end
data compression research.

CompressAI is built on top of PyTorch and provides:

* a partial port of the official `TensorFlow implementation
  <https://github.com/tensorflow/compression>`_ of *Ball√© et al.* research

* pre-trained, state-of-the-art, end-to-end compression models for learned image
  compression

* evaluation scripts to compare learned models against classical image/video
  compression codecs
